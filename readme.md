#ASMS Kiosk App

This app is made for the [Australian Science and Mathematics School](http://www.asms.sa.edu.au) (DECD) in South Australia for the kiosk computers
in front of the IT office.

##Primary Users
* Parents
* Students
* Visitors and Guests

##Expected Content
* ASMS Newsfeed (Website RSS feed)
* Maps of the ASMS buildings (Main building + Sturt buildings)
* Web links to major ASMS sites (ASMS Website, Portal and maybe PL Blog)
* Upcoming events at the ASMS (Currently uses Events RSS but may use AEMS in the future)
* RSS feeds of important ASMS blogs (PL Blog, Public newsfeed, Events)
* Information about the ASMS
* Galleries of past events

##Problems
* I can't get the gallery functions to work. You can see current progress in the `generateGalleryContent` function in data.js (it's at the bottom)
* Modifying the home template to allow other content to exist alongside of the home grid
